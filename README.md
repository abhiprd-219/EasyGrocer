The main motivation to suggest this project is because we can add all knowledge from the service now. It's real-life daily used by us idea and we will be having some references also available. We will be implementing as much as we can because implementation more can be the edge case. We can customize according to ourselves and explore more.

**Roles, Assignment, Table, Catalog items, Design, and workflow all can be decided by just following an example as a user or backend side.**

 After users create an account or log in to their existing account to access the application features.

#### Browse/Search for Items:
*Users can browse through categories or use the search bar to find specific grocery items they need. At the header section, there will be a search bar that will be according to categories like dairy, vegetables, fruits, snacks, etc*

#### Add Items to Cart:
*Once users find the desired items, they can add them to their virtual shopping cart. The cart will contain the price with item details.*

#### View/Edit Cart: 
*This will be the follow-up to the earlier section where users can review the items in their cart, adjust quantities, or remove items as needed.*

#### Checkout:
*Users proceed to the checkout process, where they provide delivery details such as address and preferred delivery time.*

#### Payment: 
*Instead of payment integration if we are not able to do then we can follow an idea because adding payment is one of the main features so for that what we can do is add some amount of coins (default value) to every user like 1000 and it will work as real money whenever a user buy something that much amount will get deducted from his account.*

#### Order Confirmation: 
*After the payment is processed, users receive an order confirmation with details such as the order number and estimated delivery time.*


#### Arrange and get ready to pick the items:
*An employee of the store will arrange all the items for the delivery boy*

#### Assign to Delivery Boy: 
*The app assigns the order to an available delivery boy based on proximity and workload.*

#### Delivery: 
*The delivery boy picks up the order from the store and heads to the user's location for delivery.*

#### Real-Time Tracking: 
*Instead of this we can add approval of the user that he had received the order.*

#### Delivery Confirmation: 
*After confirmation from the user then only the delivery boy can set the order to be delivered and users receive a notification confirming the delivery.*

#### Review & Feedback: 
*Users have the option to leave feedback and ratings based on their experience with the delivery and the quality of the items received.*

#### Repeat Orders: 
*Users can easily reorder items from their order history or saved lists for convenience.*

#### Account Management: 
*Users can manage their account details, including personal information, addresses, and payment methods, within the app.*

#### Support & Help(Chat Bot): 
*Users have access to customer support and help resources within the app for any queries or assistance they may need.*
